			<h1>Advanced settings</h1>
		</div>
		<p>This section details the advanced configuration options of
		MarcoPolo. <b>Please be aware that changing these settings could
		have a detrimental effect on your computer's performance, as
		well as MarcoPolo's performance.</b>
		</p>

		<h2>Time interval between re-evaluating rules</h2>
		<p>The main MarcoPolo thread runs in a loop, gathering evidence
		from each evidence source, evaluating it against all the rules,
		and computing the correct context. This setting controls the
		length of time to pause between these cycles.
		</p>

		<h2>WiFi always scans, even when associated</h2>
		<p>When the WiFi evidence source does a complete scan, the
		hardware is required to switch through all the IEEE 802.11
		channels to listen for access points using those channels. This
		process can take up to a few seconds, during which any wireless
		network connection will be disrupted.
		<p>The WiFi evidence source will not normally do a complete
		scan when you are connected to an access point, but you can
		enable this option to force it to do so.
