			<h1>Setting up MarcoPolo's rules</h1>
		</div>
		<p><b>Rules</b> in MarcoPolo are how MarcoPolo determines your
		context from different sources of evidence.
		Different <i>types</i> of rules for different types of
		evidence, but they are all combined mathematically to arrive at
		a final conclusion.
		</p>
		<p>It is important to remember that evidence sources can
		generate different types of evidence, and that each type is
		matched by a different type of rule. For example, the WiFi
		evidence source generates <em>SSID</em> evidence (the SSID, or
		name, of the access point) as well as <em>MAC</em> evidence
		(the unique identifier for that piece of network hardware).
		</p>
		<p>Each rule has the following properties:
		</p>
		<ul>
		<li>A <i>type</i>, specifying the type of evidence it matches,</li>
		<li>A <i>parameter</i> to determine what it matches,</li>
		<li>A <i>context</i> that it indicates,</li>
		<li>A <i>confidence</i> (0-100%), and</li>
		<li>A <i>description</i> (optional) for human readability.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For example, a rule might be:
		</p>
		<p style="text-align: center;">
		&lt; type=Bluetooth, parameter=00-00-6C-33-7A-2F, context=Home,
		confidence=80% &gt;
		</p>
		<p>This tells MarcoPolo that the presence of a <i>Bluetooth</i>
		device with a MAC of <i>00-00-6C-33-7A-2F</i> means that we are
		at the <i>Home</i> context, and that we can be <i>80%</i>
		confident of this. Ordinarily, you won't have to explicitly
		set the parameter, but it's sometimes useful to be able to
		tweak it.
		</p>
		<p>MarcoPolo frequently evaluates all its rules, and finds the
		subset of rules that match. It combines all these rules to get
		a confidence for each context, and decides on the highest
		confidence context. If the confidence for that context is
		greater than a threshold (configurable in the Preferences
		window), and the context is not the current one, MarcoPolo
		changes to that context, and triggers any relevant actions.
