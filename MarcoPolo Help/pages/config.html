			<h1>Configuring MarcoPolo</h1>
		</div>
		<p>This section deals with the overall configuration of
		MarcoPolo; it doesn't cover <a href="rules.html">rules</a> or
		<a href="actions.html">actions</a>.
		</p>
		<p>MarcoPolo runs from the <em>status bar</em> (the right-hand
		portion of the menu bar containing icons), and does not show in
		the Dock. You can access MarcoPolo's preferences and other
		features through the MarcoPolo icon.
		</p>

		<h2>Enabling automatic switching</h2>
		<p>The 'Enable automatic switching' option needs to checked in
		the General preferences for automatic switching to occur. Other
		functionality, such as forced switching, will still work if
		this option is unchecked.
		</p>

		<h2>Hiding from status bar</h2>
		<p>If the 'Hide from status bar' option is checked in the
		General preferences, the MarcoPolo icon in the status bar will
		disappear about 10 seconds after launching (or after enabling
		this option). To restore the icon to access preferences,
		simply relaunch MarcoPolo, and the icon will be visible again
		for another 10 seconds.
		</p>

		<h2>Switch Smoothing</h2>
		<p>Some evidence sources in MarcoPolo can occasionally return
		spurious data, either due to bad hardware (such as USB), or
		fundamentally unreliable physical circumstances (such as WiFi).
		This can sometimes cause MarcoPolo to momentarily switch away
		from the current (correct) context, and then switch back once
		the evidence source corrects itself.
		</p>
		<p>If you check the 'Use switch smoothing' option in the
		General preferences, MarcoPolo will delay all context
		switching until two consecutive rule evaluations both yield the
		same guess. The interval between rule evaluations defaults to
		five seconds, so using switch smoothing will delay legitimate
		context changes by this length of time.
		</p>

		<h2>Default Context</h2>
		<p>Sometimes MarcoPolo doesn't have enough evidence to make a
		confident enough guess as to your correct context. You can
		specify a <em>default context</em> to be used in these
		situations.
		</p>

		<h2>Confidence required</h2>
		<p>After MarcoPolo has combined all the matching rules, it
		arrives at a confidence for each possible context. The
		minimum confidence threshold is configurable via this slider.
